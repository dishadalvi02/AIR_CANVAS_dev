# AIR CANVAS - Writing in Air ‚úçÔ∏è

The **AIR CANVAS** project aims to create a hand gesture-based writing and recognition system where users can write or draw on a digital canvas using intuitive hand movements captured by a webcam. It involves **real-time hand tracking**, **gesture recognition**, and **character recognition** to allow users to input text or draw shapes in the air.

## üöÄ Features
- **Write in Air:** Use hand gestures to write letters or draw shapes.
- **Real-Time Recognition:** Processes hand movements instantly for accurate text recognition.
- **Hand Tracking & Gesture Recognition:** Detects and follows the movement of the hand to recognize characters.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Compares and integrates CNN and DenseNet201 for optimal performance.
- **Interactive Interface:** Displays recognized text or drawings in real-time.
